This is one of the projects of the JavaScript course I did from Udemy by Jonas Schmedtmann.

This app simulates the banking transactions i.e each transaction is reflected in both accounts (sender and receiver).

You can test this by transferring from one account, then logging into the receiver account and checking it there.

###### Demo accounts to test the application:

Account 1

- Username: js

- PIN: 1111


Account 2

- Username: jd

- PIN: 2222

###### You can test the app live [here](https://simulate-bank-app.netlify.app/).
